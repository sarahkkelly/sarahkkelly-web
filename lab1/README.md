Reflective Analysis:

As an avid user of Pacific Spirit Park for trail running, I frequently use Google Maps or other similar sites to plan routes based on the distance I want to travel or areas I want to explore. As sites like Google Maps are mostly useful for navigational purposes, the objective of my map was to create a more comprehensive guide to the trails of Pacific Spirit. For all trail segments in the park, my map includes popups with a trail description, distance, use type, and level of elevation change. It also includes the locations of all the park entrances.

The focus of the map is Pacific Spirit Regional Park, and more specifically the trails in it. As such, I removed a lot of detail from the areas of the city surrounding the park. I decided to include road labels for navigation, as well as a few points of interest just outside the park to assist with wayfinding. Outside the park, I used light brown-grey for buildings and labels, light greens for park areas, and white for the roads. By using a consistent colour palette of light, muted, earthy colours throughout, I was able to achieve visual harmony (Lee, n.d., pp. 20-21). Inside the park, I also used a light green background to ensure that emphasis was on the trails. For the trails I used a darker green for multi use trails and a dark yellow for the trails that are pedestrian only, meaning they do not allow bicycles. Furthermore, when zoomed out to the entire extent of the park, the trail colours are slightly lighter than when you zoom in. This transition is subtle, however it makes the map more visually appealing when zoomed out. Similarly, the thickness of the trails is thinner when viewing the entire extent of the park, and becomes thicker as you zoom in. Moreover, I included labels on the trails to better distinguish between them. For trail, road, and point of interest labels, I used a halo behind the text to bring the labels to the foreground, allowing the letters to better stand out (Lee, n.d., p. 29). To ensure a consistent look, I used the same font for all labels on the map. However, I varied the case and width of the text depending on the purpose. For example, I chose to style the trail labels in uppercase, as the trails are the focal point, I wanted to differentiate them from the road, water, and point of interest labels. The label text increases in size as you zoom into the map.

In the future as I develop my skills further, I would like to continue adding to this map to improve its utility. More specifically, when clicking on a trail segment, it would be very useful to have that part of the trail change colour. This would emphasize exactly what part of the trail is being described. Furthermore, it would be really interesting to generate an elevation profile for each trail segment and have it appear as an image along with the popup, when a trail is clicked. Achieving this feature appeared to be beyond the scope of this assignment, so instead I included a more simplistic measure of elevation, by classifying the elevation change of each trail as high, moderate, or low.

I exchanged critiques with Simen Hennum. At the time when he looked at my map, I had only included trail and road labels. He indicated that adding some additional labels in and around Pacific Spirit would be beneficial for users who are not as familiar with the area. As a result, I added labels for golf courses, beaches, schools, features in the park, and nearby points of interest. I think these additions add context without drawing attention away from the trails. Andrea Sze, Anna Rumaner, and I also assisted each other through the map making process.
